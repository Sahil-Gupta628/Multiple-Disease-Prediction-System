![MDPS](images/MDPSImage.jpg)

The **Multiple Disease Prediction System** is a web application that enables users to predict the likelihood of three major diseases:
- **Heart Disease**
- **Kidney Disease**
- **Diabetes**

The models are trained using machine learning techniques on specific datasets and deployed via a user-friendly interface built with **Streamlit**.
